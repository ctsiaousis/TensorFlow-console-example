# A TensorFlow C API used in a Qt Console Application

It was compiled using Qt 5.15.2 and the MinGW 64-bit compiler, but should work with MSVC 64-bit aswell.

## How To

* First download the TensorFlow C API from [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c) link. I used the windows CPU only library.
* Extract the contents on a directory called TensorFlow, located on a directory Libraries inside your projects directory.
* Clone this repo inside your project directory.
* Open the file `TensorFlow-console-example.pro` with Qt Creator and build
